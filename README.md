# Suggestions 

If you have suggestions about game functionality please let me know via email or discord or twitch. Do not put suggestions as bugs please. Suggestions are welcome.
Streaming and recording game footage for Youtube and twitch is fine however, do not spread around the story of the game when the story patches come out. So for example donâ€™t go on twitter and explain the story. I will accept constructive criticism as well. If you do not like the game because it was made in unity then you may not do the above, and you should reevaluate your life.
